Instructions
1 Right-click the SLN file you want to use to convert the Word content.
  Click "Open With" and then double-click Visual Basic to open the software and load the code.
  The SLN file contains all VB code files you create in the project.
  When you save a project in VB6, an SLN file is automatically created 
  to store all of your source code files.

2 Click the file in the solution panel to open it in the editor. 
  Start the code by opening the Word document. 
  The following code shows you how to open the Word doc:

  Dim app As Word.Application
  Dim doc As Word.Document
  Set app = New Word.Application
  Set doc = app.Documents.Open("C:\doc.doc")

  Replace the "doc.doc" file name and path with the name and path of your own Word document.

3 Select the Word content and save the content to a VB6 string.
  The following code shows you how to save the word content to a string:

  Dim content As String
  content = doc.Content

4 Convert the content to an HTML string.
  The following code creates an HTML page and uses the Word content as the body of the HTML format:

  Dim html As String
  html = "<html><head></head><body>" & content & "</body></html>"
